# ‚úàÔ∏è Decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Flight Path Recalibration in Weather and Traffic Conditions

This repository contains the source code, Jupyter Notebook, and supporting files for the Capstone project titled:

---

This project presents a decentralized approach to optimizing aircraft flight paths by integrating **real-time weather** and **air traffic data** using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**. A hybrid optimization engine combining reinforcement learning with traditional algorithms dynamically generates optimal, weather-diverted, and traffic-avoidance paths.

Key Outcomes:
- 95% path similarity to shortest paths
- 97% route efficiency
- Navigation precision with average error of 11.7 km
- 12% and 14% efficiency impact for weather and traffic, respectively

---

## üß† Core Concepts

- **Adaptive Network Graph**: Incorporates real-time NOAA (weather) and ADS-B Exchange (traffic) data.
- **Composite Edge Weights**: Weighted by distance, weather severity, and traffic congestion.
- **Dueling Deep Q-Network (DDQN)**: Used for learning dynamic flight policies.
- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: Generates paths based on prioritized parameters (distance, safety, fuel).
